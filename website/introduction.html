Reddit, known for its lively and quick-paced exchange of ideas, offers a rich tapestry of opinions, tips, and trends shared by makeup enthusiasts, making it a treasure trove for anyone interested in the pulse of the beauty world.

										<br><br>Our aim was to delve deep into this active online community to uncover what excites, motivates, and engages its members. From discussions about the latest makeup products to advice on skincare routines, the MakeupAddiction subreddit is a dynamic platform where new ideas and trends emerge constantly. By examining over one million comments and a hundred thousand posts, our project seeks to draw a comprehensive picture of the beauty landscape as shaped by real users' conversations and interactions.

										<p>The description of the variables relevant to our study can be found in the accompanying table. While we won't be analyzing every variable, our focus will be on data that is both prevalent and significant across the posts. This approach involves prioritizing data that offers the most insight and is representative of the community's discussions. Variables with a high number of missing values will be excluded from our analysis to ensure the accuracy and relevance of our findings. This strategy allows us to concentrate on the most meaningful and informative aspects of the data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the trends and topics that resonate within the MakeupAddiction subreddit.</p>

									<h2><b>Interesting Variables For EDA Analysis</b></h2>
									<li><b>Inclusion of Content Categorization Dummy Variables</b></li>
									<p>We included the dummy variables “Skincare,” “Bodycare,” and “Makeup” to categorize and analyze specific content areas within the “MakeupAddiction” subreddit. These variables allow us to differentiate posts related to skincare, body care, and makeup, enabling focused analysis of user preferences, engagement levels, and trends within each of these beauty-related topics. This segmentation enhances our ability to conduct targeted analyses, identify prevalent content categories, and uncover unique patterns, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive EDA of the subreddit.</p>
									<li><b>Introduction of New Variables</b></li>
									<p>The creation of the new variables “is_top_100_creator,” “is_peak_hours,” and “is_long_text” enriches our analysis of the subreddit. “is_top_100_creator” identifies influential users, aiding our study of their impact on the community. “is_peak_hours” helps us determine optimal posting times and provides insights into community activity patterns. “is_long_text” allows us to differentiate lengthy textual content, facilitating in-depth textual analysis. These variables offer a nuanced understanding of user behavior, content dynamics, and community engagement, enhancing the depth and comprehensiveness of our analysis.	</p>

									<li><b>Expansion to Product and Brand Analysis (Dummy Variables)</b></li>
									<p>In addition, we introduced dummy variables such as “skincare_product,” “skincare_product_brand,” “makeup_product,” and “makeup_product_brand.” These variables allow us to explore specific products within the skincare, makeup, and body care categories. Furthermore, they enable us to identify the brands associated with these products. This structured approach enhances the granularity of our analysis, enabling us to uncover patterns and preferences related to specific products and brands within each beauty category, providing a more detailed and insightful perspective on the “MakeupAddiction”</p>
									</section>
									<section id="external" class="main">
									<li><b>Add External New Variables</b></li>
									<p>In our analysis of the MakeupAddiction subreddit, we've incorporated "posting_karma" as a new variable to gauge the influence and engagement of users. This metric reflects a Reddit user's community contributions, offering insights into their reputation and the reception of their content. Higher Karma scores, indicative of greater influence and credibility, are particularly valuable for identifying influential users for potential collaborations. This addition aids in understanding the correlation between a user's Karma and the popularity of their posts, enhancing our ability to devise effective content strategies and deepen our understanding of user dynamics within the community.</p>

								<h2><b>11 Data Science Topics</b></h2>
								<h3>Exploratory</h3>
								<h4><b>Cultivating Optimal Posting Strategies: Unveiling Makeup Trends on ‘MakeupAddiction’ for Influencers and Brands</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Business Goals:</li>
    <p>Our aim is to ascertain the most effective posting times for influencers and brands on the MakeupAddiction subreddit. This entails pinpointing peak hours and discerning the influence of seasonality, festivals, and holidays on makeup-related content, guiding them to maximize their online presence and audience engagement.</p>
	<li>Technical Proposals:</li>
<p>In our study covering 2021 to 2023, we will meticulously analyze the subreddit's daily posting patterns. This involves categorizing and counting submissions by the hour, using data from the created_utc column to assess both the volume and average scores of posts. To present these findings, we'll employ a dual-axis time-series plot combining line and bar graphs - the line graph representing hourly post volumes and the bar graph depicting average post scores, with distinct color coding for clarity. Additionally, we will explore yearly trends by examining post dates, allowing us to understand how posting frequency and engagement scores fluctuate over time.</p>
</ul>

<h4><b>Unveiling Beauty Influencers: Identifying Top 10 Content Creators in the ‘MakeupAddiction’ Subreddit for Strategic Brand Collaborations</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Business Goals:</li>
    <p>Our objective is to delve into the MakeupAddiction subreddit and uncover the top ten beauty content creators, assessing their influence and potential for brand collaborations and promotional activities. This involves a deep analysis of their reach within the community, evaluating their impact not just in terms of followers but also the extent of engagement they foster.</p>
	<li>Technical Proposal:</li>
	<p>To achieve this, we will methodically filter and organize the data by author, employing a sophisticated weighted scoring system to evaluate both the popularity and the frequency of their contributions. This system will consider key factors like post scores and the number of comments, as well as the sheer volume of posts each creator has made. Our analysis will span three years—2021, 2022, and 2023—to capture a comprehensive view of their evolving influence over time. The resulting summary won’t just list these top creators; it will offer a detailed exploration of their digital footprint within the subreddit, highlighting how their content resonates with and shapes the community.</p>

    <p>Our project delves into the MakeupAddiction subreddit, focusing from 2021 to 2023, to determine the real impact of visual elements on user engagement and popularity. The objective is to discern whether visuals like gifs, videos, and images significantly boost interaction and attention within the beauty community. This insight is vital for influencers and brands, as it guides them in developing content strategies that resonate more effectively with their audience, aligning with the evolving trends and preferences in the digital beauty space.</p>
	<li>Technical Proposal:</li>
<p>In our detailed analysis, employing methods like t-tests and boxplot visualization, we discovered that visual content does not always guarantee higher engagement, as posts with visual elements often showed lower interaction compared to text-based posts. This revelation challenges the prevalent notion of visuals being universally more engaging, indicating a more complex interaction between media content and user response on the subreddit. </p>

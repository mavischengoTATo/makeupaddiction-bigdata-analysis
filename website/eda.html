                         <p>In our analysis of the datasets from the "MakeupAddiction" subreddit, we first undertake a thorough assessment of missing values. Given the extensive number of columns in the submissions dataset, we streamline our focus by pre-selecting columns pertinent to our forthcoming analysis. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous examination for potential data corruption. This involves identifying and scrutinizing any rows with anomalies that could signify data integrity issues, such as irregular patterns or incomplete records.                         </p>
                          <p>Upon inspecting the comments dataset for missing values, we discovered that the columns `author_cakeday`, `author_flair_css_class`, and `author_flair_text` exhibit a missing value rate exceeding 99%. This high percentage of absence indicates that these columns hold minimal informational value. Consequently, to streamline our dataset and enhance analytical efficiency, we have decided to omit these columns from the comments dataset.</p>
                          <p>While inspecting the submissions dataset for missing values, we discorvered that the columns `thumbnail_height`,`thumbnail_width`,`Media`,`post_hint`,`promoted`,`promoted_by`,`promoted_display_name`,<br>`promoted_url`,`original_link`,`link_flair_text`,`embed_type`,`domain_override`,`author_flair_text`,`brand_safe`,<br>`crosspost_parent`,`crosspost_parent_list`,`disable_comments`,`distinguished` and `domain` exhibit a missing value rate exceeding 99%. This high percentage of absence indicates that these columns hold minimal informational value. Consequently, to streamline our dataset and enhance analytical efficiency, we have decided to omit these columns from the submissions dataset.</p>
                      <p>Upon examining the text content of submissions and comments, it was discovered that there are more than 372,000 instances where comment bodies contain zero characters. Conversely, submission titles are consistently populated, with none having zero characters. However, there are more than 78,000 cases where the 'selftext' field—typically containing the main body of a submission—is empty, showing zero characters in length.</p>

                        <p>We performed statistical tests to analyze engagement differences between adult and youth posts on a subreddit, where the null hypothesis posited no difference in engagement levels. Table 3 indicated adults had lower engagement, with an average of 4.67 comments and 33.39 scores, while youth had higher engagement, averaging 10.69 comments and 98.26 scores. Despite the difference, both demographics showed variability, as evidenced by high standard deviations and a range of interactions, with some posts reaching up to 821 comments for adults and 15,444 for youth, and scores peaking at 11,110 for adults and 49,187 for youth. Our t-test resulted in T-statistics of -7.29 for comments and -6.13 for scores, and the Mann-Whitney U Test showed U-statistics of 40,454,428 for comments and 37,070,713.5 for scores, with P-values far below the 0.05 threshold. These statistically significant results led us to reject the null hypothesis, confirming the observed differences in engagement between adult and youth submissions and suggesting more active engagement and possibly a broader audience among the youth.</p>

<p>Fig 2 displays the hourly post volume and average score trends on the MakeupAddiction subreddit. The data indicates that post volume maintains a moderate level during morning hours, experiences a downturn in the early hours, and subsequently exhibits an ascending trajectory, culminating in a peak during the evening. Concurrently, the average score, indicative of user engagement, reaches its zenith at approximately 13:00-14:00. This peak in average score suggests a window of heightened interaction. As the day progresses into evening hours, both the post volume and average score witness a substantial increase, denoting a period of intensified activity and engagement within the subreddit community.</p>

                      <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><b>Fig3: Daily Post Volume and Average Score</b></figcaption>
                      <p>The daily post count (depicted by the blue line) on the MakeupAddiction subreddit, Fig 3 demonstrates notable fluctuations, with episodic spikes that may correspond with specific events or seasonal trends, such as increased activity around Halloween or a surge during the festive period in December. These variations suggest that user participation is influenced by external events which inspire sharing related content. The average score per post, illustrated by the orange line, maintains a relatively stable pattern, with minimal variation, except for a striking upsurge around January 2023. This anomaly indicates a day of exceptional engagement, where the content, albeit less in quantity, resonated strongly with the community, garnering substantial upvotes.</p>
                      <p>In the broader view, the data lacks a clear progressive trend or seasonality over the two-year span, with both metrics experiencing regular fluctuations. This observation implies that the community’s interaction and content appreciation are dynamic and do not adhere to a predictable pattern.While the hourly analysis previously hinted at an inverse correlation between post volume and average score, the daily data does not consistently support this relationship, underscoring the complexity of user engagement and content valuation on a day-to-day basis.</p>

                      <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><b>Fig4: Top 10 Tags Each Year</b></figcaption>
                      <p>The bar chart from the MakeupAddiction subreddit shows changing trends over three years. In 2021, ‘face of the day’ was highly popular, indicating a focus on showcasing daily makeup looks. This interest sharply declines over the next two years. The ‘question’ tag gains prominence in 2022 and 2023, suggesting a shift towards seeking advice and knowledge sharing within the community. ‘Discussion’ remains stable initially but decreases in 2023, indicating possible changes in community engagement. ‘Haul’, ‘review’, and ‘tutorial’ tags have a moderate and relatively steady presence, reflecting a consistent interest in product-related content and educational posts. Seasonal tags like ‘Halloween’ and less frequent tags such as ‘news’ highlight specific, time-bound, or niche interests within the subreddit. Overall, the community’s focus seems to have moved from personal makeup displays to informational exchanges.</p>
                      <h4><b>The impact of visual elements in posts (e.g., images) on user engagement and popularity</b></h4>
                      <iframe src="eda/media.html"  width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
                      <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><b>Fig5: Media V.S. Popularity</b></figcaption>
                      <p>The boxplot analysis of subreddit posts reveals a trend of generally low engagement scores, regardless of media presence. Posts with media show limited variability, primarily clustering at lower engagement levels. In contrast, posts without media, while also predominantly low in engagement, include a few notable outliers with scores reaching as high as 50,000. These exceptional cases suggest a potential for higher engagement in media-free posts but are anomalies within an overall pattern of minimal interaction.<br><br>

                        This observation complements the statistical analysis, which challenges the null hypothesis (H0) of no significant difference in average scores between posts with and without media. The alternative hypothesis (H1) posits a significant disparity. Our t-test, showing a T-statistic of -13.51 and a near-zero P-value, strongly supports rejecting H0, confirming H1 that submissions with media tend to have lower average scores. This result aligns with the boxplot findings and underscores the impact of media presence on user engagement scores in subreddit posts.</p>

                      <h4><b>3 New variables</b></h4>
                <p>To prepare for the proposed NLP topics, we have introduced three new variables through the process of exploratory data transformation.</p>
                <li><b>is_top_100 author: </b>We identified the top 100 authors during the exploratory phase and compiled a list of their names. This new variable was generated by verifying if the creator’s name appeared in the top 100 authors list.</li>
                <li><b>is_peak_hours:</b>We defined ‘peak hours’ as the time frames with a post volume exceeding 500, specifically from ‘hour’ 16 to 23 and ‘hour’ 0. This variable was created by validating if the posting time fell within these peak hours.</li>
                <li><b>is_long_text:</b>we categorized ‘long text’ as comments with a ‘body’ length exceeding 100 and submissions with a ‘selftext’ length exceeding 200. This distinction aids in assessing content quality, summarization, and other feature engineering tasks for sentiment analysis.</li><br>
              
                <h4><b>6 Dummy variables</b></h4>
                <p>By examining the submissions and comments, and leveraging our expertise as makeup enthusiasts, we have discerned four common topics that demand further exploration. Utilizing regular expression searches for ‘makeup’, ‘skincare’, ‘skincare_product’, ‘skincare_product_brand’,‘makeup_product’,‘makeup_product_brand’,we have created corresponding dummy variables.</p>

                <p>The data reveals patterns in both submissions and comments regarding the time of posting, author status, text length, and content focus (skincare or makeup-related). The use of specific brands and products in both submissions and comments is quantitatively analyzed, providing a clear picture of the most discussed brands and products in the forum. </p>
                <p>The NLP analysis of beauty brands on the MakeupAddiction forum leverages dummy variables to categorize data into “Skincare” and “Makeup,” enabling precise analysis. Brand mentions are extracted and tallied within these categories using NLP techniques. Sentiment analysis of comments discerns consumer attitudes towards brands as positive, negative, or neutral. This integrated approach of data categorization, brand analysis, and sentiment assessment offers a detailed understanding of popular brands and consumer sentiment, informing strategic decisions in marketing and product development.</p>

                      <h4><b>New variable from external resource: posting_karma</b></h4>
                      <p>“Karma is a reflection of how much a Redditor’s contributions mean to the community. Making posts that communities find valuable is the way to gain Karma.” –Reddit.com                </p>
                      <p>Creators with higher Reddit Karma scores often have a history of posting high-quality content, engaging in meaningful discussions, and contributing positively to the community. Their high Karma scores suggest that their posts and comments are well-received by other Redditors. They are more likely to have a deep understanding of the community’s preferences and interests. By integrating Karma as an external data source, we can enrich our analysis and identify not only the top creators based on their post frequency and popularity but also those who have earned credibility, recognition, and respect within the community. Redditor’s Karma in provided by Reddit API and can be rerieved using the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library.</p>
                      <h4><b>Potential new variable from external resource: brands_trend</b></h4>
                      <p>We use `pytrends`, an unofficial API for Google Trends, to retrieve search interest data for makeup and skincare brands and products like "Sephora," "Nars," "YSL," and "Ulta Beauty" from 2021 to 2023 in the US. The data can be used in NLP to analyze trends in brand popularity and consumer interest over time.</p>
                       
                        
                       
                      <h4><b>Google Trends</h4></b>
                      <p>Google Trends, accessible via the TrendReq library, analyzes the frequency of specific search terms in relation to total search volume, offering insights into their popularity and trends over time. This tool is particularly useful in tracking the popularity trends of brands under the MakeupAddiction topic for a specified timeframe, providing valuable data for market research, content creation, and decision-making in proposed NLP and machine learning projects.</p>

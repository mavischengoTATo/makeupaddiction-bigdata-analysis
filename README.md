# Big Data Analysis of Engagement and Influencer Dynamics on Reddit’s ‘MakeupAddiction’ Using AWS

## Introduction

Welcome to **Data Science Analysis of the 'MakeupAddiction' Subreddit (2021-2023)**. This project aims to reveal insights into engagement trends, influencer dynamics, and sentiment within the beauty-focused 'MakeupAddiction' community on Reddit. By leveraging big data, NLP, and machine learning, our analysis provides strategic insights for brands, influencers, and community managers, helping them align with audience sentiment and optimize content strategies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our EDA phase focuses on uncovering initial patterns and preparing the data for further analysis. Key steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Filtering and cleaning data, removing irrelevant columns, and preparing text data for NLP.
2. **Descriptive Analysis**: Evaluating user interaction metrics, such as post frequency, upvotes, and comments, to understand engagement levels.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing engagement trends over time, influencer impacts, and posting patterns to identify peak hours and seasonal trends.

Our EDA insights provide a foundational understanding of community behaviors and lay the groundwork for more targeted NLP and machine learning tasks.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

In the NLP phase, we delve into sentiment analysis and topic modeling to extract deeper insights:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Assessing user sentiment towards influencers, trending topics, and specific brands within the subreddit.
2. **Topic Modeling**: Identifying key themes and evolving language trends in user interactions to capture the community's focal points and interests.

These NLP insights allow brands and influencers to align their messaging with community preferences and understand emotional responses to different topics.

## Machine Learning (ML)

The ML phase leverages predictive models to enhance engagement analysis and content recommendations. Major components include:

1. **Post Popularity Prediction**: Classifying posts likely to achieve high engagement based on historical patterns.
2. **Content Personalization**: Using machine learning to recommend content that aligns with user preferences, enhancing user experience within the subreddit.

Our machine learning models enable influencers and brands to better predict community responses, tailoring content to maximize engagement.
